You: what's bigger? 0.99 or 0.91
AI: To determine which number is larger between **0.99** and **0.91**, let's compare them step by step.

1. **Compare the Whole Number Part:**
   - Both numbers have the same whole number part: **0**.

2. **Compare the Tenths Place:**
   - In **0.99**, the tenths digit is **9**.
   - In **0.91**, the tenths digit is **9**.
   - Since both tenths digits are equal, we move to the next decimal place.

3. **Compare the Hundredths Place:**
   - In **0.99**, the hundredths digit is **9**.
   - In **0.91**, the hundredths digit is **1**.
   - **9** (from 0.99) is greater than **1** (from 0.91).

Since the hundredths place in **0.99** is greater than in **0.91**, we conclude that:

\[
\boxed{0.99 \text{ is larger than } 0.91}
\]

**Final Answer:** \boxed{0.99}
